# fastStartup
A simple android app that automatically connects to a wifi device nearby and after connecting to it ,it accesses **_internet.iitb.ac.in_** and logs in to my account. I made this since I found myself too lazy to connect everytime ,I want to connect to internet, to this IITB server and login with my LDAP ID and password. This somewhat automates this process with just a single touch. !!!
